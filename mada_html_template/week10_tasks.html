        <h2>Reflective Statement on Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
            In reflecting on the accessibility of my website, I realize that while the design process has not explicitly prioritized accessibility until now, several elements were organically integrated. For instance, the use of responsive design ensures that the website is viewable across different devices, which benefits users with varying needs. Additionally, the inclusion of descriptive alt text for images and clear navigation supports users with visual impairments and those who rely on screen readers. However, there are areas that require improvement. For example, the website could benefit from enhanced color contrast to aid users with color blindness, and more attention should be given to keyboard navigation to accommodate users who cannot use a mouse. Moving forward, incorporating these considerations from the outset will ensure a more inclusive user experience for everyone.
