                <h3>Analysis of Audio on Rorqual Film Website</h3>
                <p>
                    The Rorqual Film website uses audio strategically to enhance the cinematic experience of visitors. Upon entering the website, visitors are greeted with atmospheric background music that sets the mood for exploring the content related to the film.
                </p>
                <audio controls>
                    <source src="audio/wwf.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                </audio>
                <p>
                    The audio on Rorqual's website serves multiple purposes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It creates an immersive environment that aligns with the theme and genre of the film.</li>
                    <li>It enhances emotional engagement by evoking specific moods and feelings.</li>
                    <li>It reinforces the visual content, such as trailers and stills, by providing a cohesive audio-visual experience.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Advantages of audio use include enriching user experience, strengthening brand identity, and effectively conveying the artistic vision of the film. However, potential caveats include accessibility concerns for users who may prefer or require silent browsing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Audio is integrated with other media elements on the website, such as video trailers and textual descriptions, to create a multimedia experience that captivates and informs visitors about the film.
