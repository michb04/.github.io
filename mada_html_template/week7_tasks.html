            <h2>Task 1: Reflection on the Creative Process and Design Thinking</h2>
            <div class="reflection">
                <h3>Reflection on the Creative Process</h3>
                <p>Throughout this term, I have actively engaged in the creative process while working on various multimedia projects. One specific example is when I was tasked with designing a web interface for a health information portal. During the <strong>Preparation</strong> stage, I immersed myself in researching user preferences and current design trends in healthcare websites. This initial phase allowed me to gather insights and inspiration, which formed the basis of my design concepts.</p>
                
                <p>During the <strong>Incubation</strong> stage, I often found myself stepping away from the project to gain new perspectives. For instance, taking breaks and exploring unrelated creative outlets helped me return to my design with fresh ideas. This period of incubation was crucial in overcoming design challenges and refining my concepts.</p>

                <p>The <strong>Ideation</strong> stage was particularly rewarding as I brainstormed and prototyped various interface designs. I experienced moments of clarity where disparate ideas converged into cohesive solutions. This stage highlighted the importance of creativity and experimentation in achieving innovative design outcomes.</p>

                <p>In the <strong>Evaluation</strong> stage, I sought feedback from peers and mentors to critique and refine my designs. This process involved critical self-reflection and iterative improvements based on constructive criticism. It reinforced the value of collaboration and iterative design in achieving user-centered solutions.</p>

                <p>Finally, in the <strong>Implementation</strong> stage, I translated my finalized designs into functional prototypes, continuously iterating based on usability testing and user feedback. This hands-on phase underscored the iterative nature of design thinking, where continuous refinement leads to optimized user experiences.</p>

                <h3>Interaction with Design Thinking</h3>
                <p>My engagement in the creative process closely aligns with the principles of design thinking that I have learned throughout this course. Design thinking emphasizes empathy for users, defining problems, ideating solutions, prototyping iteratively, and testing with users. These principles complemented my creative process by providing a structured framework to address user needs effectively.</p>
                
                <p>For example, during the <strong>Ideation</strong> stage, design thinking encouraged me to explore divergent ideas and challenge assumptions, fostering innovative solutions. The iterative approach of design thinking, akin to the creative process’s Implementation stage, allowed me to refine my designs based on user feedback, ensuring usability and relevance.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, design thinking’s emphasis on empathy and user-centricity guided my decisions throughout the creative process. By understanding user preferences and pain points, I created designs that resonate with the target audience and address their specific needs effectively.</p>

                <p>Overall, integrating design thinking principles with the creative process enhanced my ability to conceptualise, develop, and refine multimedia projects that are both innovative and user-centered.</p>
